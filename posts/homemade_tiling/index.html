                    Making maps is hard, but other people have already solved
                    that problem‚Ä¶
                </h2>

                <p>
                    For a recent project, I wanted to create an interactive map
                    containing information about every building in Belgium. I
                    had done some simple maps in the past, but this was about 10
                    GB of geodata so I couldn't use my usual approach of putting
                    all the data in a js file and making the client load
                    everything at once: data would have to be fetch and shown on
                    a need basis, as users would move around the map.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I started looking at hosted solutions like ArcGIS or Mapbox
                    but I was quickly discouraged:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>The interfaces are soooo slow‚Ä¶</li>
                    <li>
                        My best guess for how much it was going to cost me was:
                        I lot‚Ä¶ maybe ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The only way I could find out if some features I wanted
                        were possible was to spend hours trying to make the
                        whole thing and hope for the best.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    So I thought that I could maybe do it myself. I started to
                    read about GIS servers, tile servers, vector tiles, etc.
                    Serving maps is a super common problem, so of course very
                    smart people have made incredibly powerful tools for every
                    step you need. There are standards to make everything
                    interoperable and open source frameworks that make
                    everything fast and robust. The problem is, it is still a
                    lot to learn, and I‚Äôm very lazy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I kept opening library docs, reading a few lines, realizing
                    I was out of my depth, giving up, and trying another library
                    hoping it would be simpler‚Ä¶ just to repeat the same loop.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That's how I ended up coding a very basic solution to my
                    problem from scratch. It is much worse than the existing
                    libraries, it didn't need to exist, and it might have taken
                    more time than just forcing myself to read the docs. But I
                    can spin it like a good thing if I convince myself that I
                    learned more that way, so here we go !
                </p>

                <h2>‚Ä¶ so I can solve it too, just worse</h2>

                <p>
                    Here's my plan: I know how to load geojson on a map with
                    <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>. I can't do it
                    with the full 10 GB of data, but if I split the data into 10
                    000 geojson files, I'll have chunks of ~1Mb with which I can
                    work. On the client side I'll have some JavaScript to
                    determine which file is needed, fetch it and add it to the
                    map.
                </p>

                <p>
                    10 000 is 100x100, so I can find the extent of the full map,
                    divide it in a grid of 100 rows and 100 columns to get 10
                    000 cells of equal size. Then based on the current viewbox,
                    I can easily find which cell(s) need to be loaded.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All the logic happens on the client side, so I just need to
                    store 10 000 static geojson somewhere I can fetch them
                    easily, and for that I'll use a
                    <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/"
                        >Cloudflare R2 bucket</a
                    >: my data can just fit inside the free plan, and It will be
                    able to handle millions of visits per month for free, much
                    more than what I‚Äôll likely get.

                    Let's see the basic code to make it work. I removed a lot of
                    checks and hardcoded some values to make it more readable,
                    so my actual code is twice as long, but the main logic is
                    there:

    renderer: L.canvas(), // The canvas renderer is much faster than the default SVG renderer
}).setView(init_center, init_zoom);

// Create the layer that will hold the data
const data_layer = L.geoJSON().addTo(map);

// Leaflet provides "moveend" and "zoomend" events that we'll use to update the map when the user moves or zooms
map.on("moveend", update_map);
map.on("zoomend", update_map);

2. Find the tiles that are visible in the current view
3. Fetch the visible tiles and add them to the map

    // map.getBounds() returns the current view box
    let bounds = map.getBounds();

    // find the tiles that are visible in the current view

    // fetch the visible tiles and add them to the map
    for (let tile_index of tiles) {
        // tile_index is an array with the x and y indices of the tile
        load_tile(tile_index);
    }
}

/*

    let i = tile[0];
    let j = tile[1];

    // Some code to check if the tile is already loaded, or is being loaded
    [...]

    // fetch the tile data
    let url = `https://public_url_of_R2_bucket/tile_${i}_${j}.geojson`;

    fetch(url)
        .then((response) => {
            // this should also check if the response is ok
            return response.json();
        })
        .then((data) => {
            // here we should check if the data is valid, remove some duplicates that appear on the edges,
            // record that the tile is properly loaded, etc.
            // But the last step is simply to add the new data to the map
            data_layer.addData(data);

                <p>And that‚Äôs basically the whole logic !</p>

                <h2>Ok but why ?</h2>

                <p>
                    On the one hand, it is a bit stupid to write this myself
                    given that well-tested open-source frameworks exist. I ended
                    up adding quite a lot of code to handle errors and edge
                    cases, and I‚Äôm certain it is still failing in some
                    situations. But on the other hand I really like having a
                    simple solution that I completely understand. The whole
                    thing is just a single HTML page and some vanilla
                    JavaScript, with Leaflet as the only dependency, and no
                    server logic at all. I can customize it very easily, it‚Äôs
                    fast, and I can handle a few thousands visits/hour while
                    staying comfortably inside Cloudflare‚Äôs free tier.

                    Most importantly, it was much more fun than reading the
